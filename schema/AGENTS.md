# Schema Development Workflow

When touching files in this directory:

1. Practice TDD â€” write or update tests alongside schema changes.
2. Run 'gofmt -w' on edited schema files before committing.
3. Validate the project with:
   - 'go test ./...'
   - 'go test -race ./...'
   - 'go vet ./...'
4. Prefer snake_case for all schema field names to match generated database columns.
5. Regenerate code with 'erm gen' when the schema shape changes and review the diff before committing.
